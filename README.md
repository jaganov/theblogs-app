# The Blogs - Modern Blog Platform

## Project Overview

**The Blogs** is a modern web application for creating and managing blogs. It features:

- User registration, authentication, and profile management
- Blog post creation, editing, and search (with PostgreSQL Full-Text Search)
- Calendar-based post filtering
- Extended Django admin panel
- Test data generation commands
- Dockerized deployment

### Architecture

- **Backend:** Django 5, Python 3, PostgreSQL 16
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JS, HTMX
- **DevOps:** Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx (production)
- **Apps:**
  - `account`: user management, authentication, profiles
  - `blog`: posts, search, calendar, authors

---

## Features

- List and search all blog posts (sorted by date)
- Author directory and filtering
- Calendar search for posts by date
- User registration and authentication (with HTMX forms)
- Profile editing and avatar upload
- Post creation, editing, and status (draft/published)
- Extended admin panel (user and post management)
- Automatic reading time calculation
- Test data generation (users, posts, images)

---

## Current Limitations

- **No adaptive (responsive) layout**: The UI is not mobile-friendly.
- **No asset compression/PageSpeed optimization**: Static files are not minified or optimized.
- **No dynamic loading/infinite scroll**: All content loads at once; no lazy loading or infinite scroll.
- **No social network integration**: No sharing, login, or preview for social platforms.
- **Potential for further dynamic mechanics**: More interactive features can be added.

## Assignment Requirements Checklist

This project fully implements all requirements from the assignment:

- **Display all blog posts sorted by date:**
  - Implemented on the main page (`/`), newest posts first.
- **Display the list of authors:**
  - Implemented at `/authors/`.
- **Show only the blog posts by a selected author:**
  - Implemented via author profile pages (`/@username/`).
- **Calendar date selection to filter posts:**
  - Implemented with a calendar and `/api/days-with-posts/`.
- **User registration and post creation:**
  - Implemented at `/account/register/` and `/create/`.
- **Search for blog posts by query:**
  - Implemented at `/search/` using PostgreSQL Full-Text Search.
- **Each post has an author, title, content, and date:**
  - Enforced by the data model.
- **Initial data: authors and posts:**
  - Provided by test data generation commands.
- **Pagination with "Next" and "Previous" links:**
  - Implemented in all post lists and search results.

## Quick Start

> **Note:** Creating a `.env` file is optional for local development. The project uses default parameters. See [Production Setup](./PRODUCTION_SETUP.md) to override defaults for production.

### Local Development (with Docker)
1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd theblogs_app
```

2. **(Optional) Create a `.env` file** in the root directory (see [Production Setup](./PRODUCTION_SETUP.md) for required variables).

3. **Start the stack:**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

4. **Apply migrations:**

```bash
docker compose exec web uv run python manage.py migrate
```

```bash
docker compose exec web uv run python manage.py collectstatic
```
5. **Create a superuser:**

```bash
docker compose exec web uv run python manage.py createsuperuser
```

6. **Generate test data:**

```bash
docker compose exec web uv run python manage.py generate_users --avatar-chance 1.0   # 100% users with avatars
docker compose exec web uv run python manage.py generate_posts --image-chance 0.5    # 50% posts with images
```

See [README_text_generation.md](./app/blog/management/commands/README_text_generation.md) for details on test data generation mechanics and parameters.

For full production setup, see [PRODUCTION_SETUP.md](./PRODUCTION_SETUP.md).

## Test Data Generation

The project includes management commands for generating test users and posts with avatars and images. Example usage:

```bash
python manage.py generate_users --avatar-chance 0.8   # 80% users with avatars
python manage.py generate_posts --image-chance 1.0    # 100% posts with images
```

See [README_text_generation.md](./app/blog/management/commands/README_text_generation.md) for full usage, parameters, and features.

- Automated and manual cleanup scripts for Windows/Linux/Mac
- How to remove Docker volumes and media files
- How to re-initialize the database and superuser
- Useful Docker and database commands
